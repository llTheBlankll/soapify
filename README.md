# Soapify Commission Project

## Project Overview

This project involved the design and development of a static website for Soapify, a brand dedicated to showcasing and promoting a diverse range of soap and hygiene products. The website aims to effectively communicate the brand's core values and product benefits through compelling narratives and intuitive design.

## About Soapify (Brand Narrative)

The name "Soapify" is a fusion of "soap" and "purify," reflecting the brand's identity:

*   **Soap:** Emphasizes one of the company's flagship productsâ€”soap pods.
*   **Purify:** Extends the brand's identity to include other offerings such as disinfectant pods and alcohol, all aimed at ensuring a clean and hygienic environment for customers.

The memorable and catchy brand name was strategically chosen to attract consumer attention and enhance recall. The website's "About" page further elaborates on this brand essence.
